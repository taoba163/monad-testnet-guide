## Why Monad?
- **Full EVM bytecode compatibility** – No code changes needed for Ethereum contracts.  
- **Blazing fast performance** – Targeting 10,000 TPS, ~500ms block time, ~1s finality.  
- **Low hardware requirements** – Run a node on ~$1500 consumer-grade hardware.  
- **Advanced architecture** – Parallel execution, MonadBFT consensus, optimized networking.

---

## Step 1: Connect to Monad Testnet
1. Open **MetaMask** (or any EVM-compatible wallet).  
2. Add the Monad Testnet RPC:  

```json
Network Name: Monad Testnet
RPC URL: https://rpc.testnet.monad.xyz
Chain ID: [Check official docs]
Currency Symbol: tMON
Block Explorer: https://explorer.testnet.monad.xyz
```

3. Switch to Monad Testnet in your wallet.

---

## Step 2: Get Test Tokens
- Visit the [Monad Faucet](https://testnet.monad.xyz/faucet).  
- Request test $tMON for gas fees.

---

## Step 3: Deploy Your First Contract
1. Open [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).  
2. Use the Solidity compiler (0.8.x). Example contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract HelloMonad {
    string public message = "Hello, Monad!";

    function setMessage(string calldata newMessage) public {
        message = newMessage;
    }
}
```

3. Compile and deploy to Monad Testnet using your wallet.

---

## Step 4: Interact with Your Contract
- Use Remix, Hardhat, or web3.js to call functions.  
- Test transactions and monitor them on the [Monad Testnet Explorer](https://explorer.testnet.monad.xyz).

---

## Step 5: Share & Get Feedback
- Post your deployed contract address in the Monad Discord `#dev` channel.  
- Share your experience and suggestions — feedback is highly valued.

---

## Best Practices for Contributing
- Report bugs or performance issues with reproducible steps.  
- Suggest features that improve developer experience.  
- Create tutorials, tools, or scripts that help others build faster.

## Conclusion
By building on Monad Testnet now, you position yourself as an early, valuable contributor to the ecosystem.  
The team is actively watching for meaningful contributions — and history shows that early engagement often brings long-term rewards.
